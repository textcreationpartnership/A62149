            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His GENEALOGICAL HISTORY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which (encouraged by Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Gracious Approbation and more Special Favour) I have (with the expence of all that time which in near fifteen years I could ſpare from the neceſſary attendance on that Employment which Your Majeſty hath been pleaſed to confer upon me) brought to ſuch a Perfection, as my mean Abilities could give it, (though neither ſuch as the Kingly Subject requires or deſerves) I now humbly Preſent to Your Majeſty, to Whom onely of Right it belongs, You being (as it were) the Ocean into which all theſe Mighty Springs of Royalty have, through the Streams of ſo many ſeveral Generations, diſcharged themſelves, and in Your Veins running the Royal Blood of all thoſe Kings of ſo many ſundry Nations, Who, within the Records of Time, have ſwayed the Scepter of this Noble Iſland.</p>
            <p>Your Majeſty, when You were firſt Acquainted with
<pb facs="tcp:50646:4"/>the Deſign, and whilst there was yet but a Proſpect of it, were pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That it would be a very uſeful Book.</hi> An Encouragement ſo Royal, That it was able to put life into the meaneſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker. And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but boaſt it as my greateſt Honour to acknowledge that the Remembrance of thoſe Words of Your Majeſty, did, through the whole Courſe of the Work, Animate me to a more diligent Search and ſtricter Scrutiny of the certainty of Things, in a Matter ſo Nice and Curious, ſo No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Illuſtrious; That this Hiſtory, which I wanted the Art to adorn with the Flouriſhes of Eloquence, might at leaſt appear to the World, though in the leſs Gorgeous, yet more Glorious Habit of Truth.</p>
            <p>Nor do I doubt, but in this Plain and Humble Dreſs (guarded by Your Majeſties Patronage and Approbation) it may prove as Acceptable to all Well-minded Men, and produce its deſired Effects, which are, The Preſerving the Memory of the Seals, Monuments, and Epitaphs of the Royal Family, from Devouring Time, and the Fate of Accidents, and the Convincing the People of the Reaſonableneſs of their Obedience. For though Kings ought to be Honoured as the lively Images of the Divinity, and Gods Vicegerents upon Earth, yet it muſt needs be Acknowledged, That when their Title is Strengthened by a Deſcent from ſo many Royal Progenitors, made Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous from Age to Age by their Renowned Actions and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical Virtues, and the Blood of all theſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited in one Perſon or Family, to make their Right indiſputable, Loyalty Redoubles, and Acts more vigorouſly in the Breaſts of thoſe Subjects whom God hath ſubmitted to ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and Lawfull an Authority.</p>
            <p>And this is a Conſideration which ought, in a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, to Oblige all Your Majeſties Subjects to a Nearer and Dearer Veneration of You their King than the Subjects of any other Prince in the World; For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they derive their Deſcent from the <hi>Britains, Saxons, Danes, Normans,</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> (of all which Nations the Inhabitants of this Iſland are Compoſed) You are ſtill their Lawfull Sovereign, by a continued Succeſsion of near Twelve hundred Years. You are Fleſh of the Fleſh,
<pb facs="tcp:50646:4"/>and Bone of the Bone of every one of us; ſo that no Native of this Iſland can ſay as once the Ten Tribes did to<note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. chap. 10. v. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Rehoboam, What Portion have we in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid? And we have no Inheritance in the Son of Jeſſe:</hi> For You are equally alike to all of us, our Portion, and our Inheritance.</p>
            <p>But this, Great SIR, is not all: Providence has not only Obliged us to our Duty, by giving us, to Rule over us, the greateſt King in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> in Reſpect of Blood: You are not only of the Moſt Antient Kingly Deſcent of any Chriſtian Monarch, being the Eleventh that in a due and direct Succeſsion have worn a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem; But You are likewiſe the Inheritor of the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Endowments of Your Royal Progenitors. Their Virtues are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited in You as well as their Blood. Not to fetch Examples from Darker Antiquity; In You we daily behold the Courage and Magnanimity of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward III.</hi> The Prudence and Policy of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VII.</hi> The Peaceable Inclination of Your Royal Grandfather King <hi>James;</hi> And the Piety and Clemency of that Bleſſed Martyr Your Father. * VVhere then ſhould we find a Center to fix our Obedience, but where Heaven has cocentred all theſe Advantages of Blood and Virtue?</p>
            <p>And yet, SIR, there ſtill remains one more Signal Obſervation, which ſeems to Cry out like a Voice from Heaven, and Challenge our Duty and Allegeance to Your Royal Line, which is, That when ever, for the Sins of the people, God hath permitted Invaders or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers to Diſturb the Peaceable Courſe of ſome of Your Anceſtors Reigns, yet never did the Intruſion laſt beyond the Third or Fourth Generation, but, by ſome means or other unthought of by and undiſcernable to Mankind, Providence hath Ordered the Return of the Crown to the Lawful Heir. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is <hi>Digitus Dei;</hi> which has powerfully been ſhewn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſundry Occaſions, but never did the Arm of God more plainly appear than in that Miraculous Preſervation and Restauration of Your Majeſty to the Throne, when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Dint of Sword, or any open Violence, even the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Your very Enemies, was, by the Divine Power,
<pb facs="tcp:50646:5"/>lull'd aſleep, and You endeared to us by being made the Reſtorer of thoſe Breaches both in Church and State, which, by the Pride, Ignorance, and Folly of a violent Party among us, were opened ſo wide, that they threatned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than utter Deſolation.</p>
            <p>And now ſurely he muſt be the moſt perverſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that will not yield that to be Right which Heaven and Earth Proclaim to be ſo, ſuch Monſters deſerve not only to be cut off from the People, but razed out of the Memory of Mankind. May Your Majeſties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions never breed more ſuch Vipers, but all Your good Subjects, with an unanimous Heart, join and ſay with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. chap. 7. v. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore now let it pleaſe thee to bleſs the Houſe of thy Servant (the King) that it may continue for ever before thee, for thou, O Lord God, haſt ſpoken it, and with thy Bleſsing let the Houſe of thy Servant be Bleſsed for ever.</hi> Which ſhall be the daily Prayer of,</p>

                        <p>To paſs by the Poetical Fictions of Deviſes aſſigned to the Trojan and Grecian Captains, thoſe attributed to <hi>Solomon, David,</hi> and <hi>Joſbua,</hi> yea and our Saviour himſelf, by Monks, Poets, and Painters (<hi>Hen. Spelman Eq. Anr. in Aſpilogia,</hi> p. 41.) We may upon better grounds not only note the Deviſes of ſeveral Romans upon their Conſular Coins (<hi>Carolus Patin in Antiquis Numiſmatibus, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 257. <hi>&amp;</hi> 313.) but take a view of their Practice in the time of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, upon whoſe Pillar (one of the Worlds moſt famous Monuments in being) are not only variety of Deviſes, but alſo the exact form and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Roman, German, and Dacian Shields. But to confine my ſelf within the limits of my Story, and to prove that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes were in uſe about the time of the Conquerour, we may note in the Challenge of <hi>Geffrey Martell</hi> Earl of of <hi>Anjou</hi> returned him, being only Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> near <hi>Damfront,</hi> by <hi>Roger de Montgomery</hi> and others; where the Earl, that he might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known to the Duke, deſcribes, <hi>Qualem Equum in praelio ſit habiturus, quate SCUTUM, &amp; qualem veſtitum:</hi> and <hi>Roger</hi> on the behalf of the Duke of <hi>Normandy, Equum viciſſim Domini ſui praefignat, veſtitum &amp; ARMA, Geſta Will. Ducis Normanuiae,</hi> pag. 113. Upon this ground <hi>Samuel Daniel</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Conquerour's Life, pag. 26 (ſurniſhed with what other Authority I know not) enlargeth thus: That Count <hi>Martell</hi> made this return by <hi>Roger de Montgomery, viz. Tell the Duke, to morrow by day-break, he ſhall have me there on a White Horſe, ready to give him the Combate, and I will enter</hi> Damfront <hi>if I can; and to the end he ſhall know me, I will wear a SHIELD d' OR without any deviſe. Roger</hi> replies, <hi>Sir you ſhall not need to take the pains, for to morrow morning you ſhall have the Duke in this place, mounted on a Bay Horſe, and that you may know him, he ſhall wear on the point of his Launce a STREAMER OF TAFFATA to wipe your face.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here was a <hi>Shield d' Or</hi> (of Gold) without any Deviſe, which implies that Deviſes were uſed in that time, but it ſeameth onely momentary, taken up, and laid down at pleaſure: For had they been perſonal, that is, for life, Count <hi>Geffrey</hi> might have been as well known by his Deviſe, as Families are by their Arms at this day. And its probable the reaſon why the Shields of that Age were leſt Blanks, or of one Simple Colour or Mettal, was to receive the Impreſs of every Fancy that either pleaſed the Bearer or the Painter.</p>

                  <p>He was (as a Modern Author renders Him) a Man ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Motion, that we cannot take His dimenſions, but only in paſſing, and that only on the ſide of War; on the other, we never ſaw but a glance on Him, which yet for the moſt part was ſuch as ſhewed Him to be a very worthy Prince, and an expert Soldier, wanting nothing to make Him an excellent King, but a good Title.

                  <p>He kept His word with the State concerning the relievement of Tributes, and never had Subſidy that we find: But which is more remarkable, having His Sword continually out, and ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions againſt Him, He never put any great Man to death.

But this report was certainly nothing elſe but a Slander; for after Her Marriage with Duke <hi>Henry,</hi> She ever led a modeſt and ſober life, without ſcandal or ſenſure. Others more judicious affirm, that the cauſe of this ſeparation was, becauſe <hi>Eleanor</hi> brought the King no Male-iſſue, which he earneſtly longed for, but onely two Daughters,<note place="margin">Saiacte Marthe, p. <hi>338</hi> b, c, d. &amp; p. <hi>339</hi> a, b.</note> which (being yet judged legitimate by the Church) were married; <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>France</hi> the Elder, to <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Troys</hi> in <hi>Campaigne,</hi> and of <hi>Brie, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Alix</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the younger daughter, was Wife of <hi>Theobald,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Good,</hi> Earl of <hi>Chartres</hi> and <hi>Blois,</hi> and Great Steward of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>He began His Reign with ſingular Prudence, making choice of the wiſeſt men He could get for Counſellors, He expelled thoſe ſtrangers brought in by King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and demoliſhed the Caſtles, the Nobility had built by His allowance (often proving Nurſeries of Rebellion) and the Crown-Lands alienated by that King, He reaſſumed, judging it ſafer to offend a few, then diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege many: And for the furtherance of Juſtice (in the One and twentieth year of His Reign) He divided His whole Realm into ſix ſeveral Circuits, appointing in every Circuit Three Judges, who twice a year rode together to adminiſter Juſtice; and to hear, and determine cauſes betwixt party and party.</p>
                  <p>His War with <hi>Owen</hi> Prince of <hi>Northwales,</hi> was rather account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an exerciſe to keep Him in motion, then to diſturb His reſt, yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Owen</hi> was not ſo eaſily reduced, but that <hi>Henry de Eſſex</hi> the Kings Standard-Bearer, being oppreſſed by the Welſh, let fall the Royal Standard in Battel; for which he was caſhiered for cowardiſe, ſhorn a Monk, and had his Lands ſeiſed into the Kings hands.</p>

                  <p>If King <hi>Henry</hi> had hitherto managed his affairs with much Wiſdom and Prudence, he now ſhews as much weakneſs and infirmity, in cauſing his ſon <hi>Henry</hi> to be made Copartner with him, in the Kingdom, and to be twice Crowned; the<note n="*" place="margin">Robert <hi>of</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, p. <hi>237</hi> b.</note> firſt time by <hi>Roger</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and a ſecond time with <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife, by the deſire of her Father King <hi>Lewis,</hi> in the City of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> by <hi>Rotrock</hi> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> where the Father deſcended ſo low, as to ſerve as a Sewer at the Table of his ambitious ſon, and made the Barons ſwear him Allegiance; which act proceeded partly from Indulgence to him, but more (it is believed) to enſure his Succeſſion to the Crown, finding by experience, that Oaths for Succeſſion are often evaded, but Oaths for preſent Allegiance, ſeldom are eluded. And now <hi>Henry</hi> the young King is blamed by his Father-in-Law, for that having entred upon the Government, and being Crowned, he would yet permit his Father to rival him in the Kingdom, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with being a Titular King onely, which eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed the youth with unjuſt deſires: So that breaking out into open hate, many quarrels aroſe betwixt the two <hi>Henries,</hi> which were at length deſided by ſharp and bloody Wars: In all which, moſt unnaturally his ſons, and moſt undutifully, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Chester,</hi> together with <hi>William,</hi> then King of <hi>Scots,</hi> taking part with the King of <hi>France,</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually overcome by King <hi>Henry,</hi> forced to an Agreement, and all their Complices upon ſubmiſſion pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Long was the contention betwixt King <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which though no equal match, yet it is hard to diſtinguiſh which had the Victory: The difference was, the King would have it ordained, that Malefactors of the Clergy ſhould be tryed before the Secular Magiſtrate, as Lay-men were. This <hi>Becket</hi> oppoſed, urging it to be againſt the Liberty of the Church, and therefore againſt Gods honor, many Biſhops ſided with the King, ſome few with the Archbiſhop; at laſt <hi>Becket</hi> ſigns the Ordinance, yet with a <hi>Salvo ordine ſuo,</hi> which not being ſatisfactory to the King, he then ſigns abſolute, without reſervation, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately recants, and hath his Temporalities ſeiſed on; upon which he flies the Realm, and his Kinred are baniſhed. <hi>Becket</hi> in this miſery continued Seven years, till by the Popes threatnings of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or by the Mediation of the King of <hi>France,</hi> he was reſtored to his Archbiſhoprick, who ſtill continuing his Pride, and interdicting thoſe Biſhops that had offended him, ſo much incenſed

After this He covered His Head with a Linnen Cloath hallowed, and ſet His Cap thereon; and then after He had put on His Royal Garments, and His upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50646:46"/>Robe, the Archbiſhop delivered Him the Sword, with which He ſhould beat down the Enemies of the Church; which done, two Earls put His Shooes upon His Feet, and having His Mantle put on Him, the Archbiſhop for bad Him on the behalf of Almighty God, not to preſume to take upon Him this Dignity, except He faithfully meant to do thoſe things He had ſworn to perform; whereunto the King made anſwer, That by Gods Grace He would perform them. Then the King took the Crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Altar, and delivered it to the Archbiſhop, which be ſet upon the Kings Head, delivering Him the Scepter to hold in His Right Hand, and the Rod-Royal in His Left Hand. And thus being Crowned, He was brought back by the Biſhops and Barons, with the Croſs and Candleſticks, and Three Swords, paſſing forth before Him to His Seat. When the Biſhop that ſung the Maſs came to the Offertory, the two Biſhops that brought Him to the Church, led Him to the Altar, and brought him back again; the Maſs ended, He was brought with ſolemn Proceſſion into His Chamber. And this was the Form of the Kings Coronation, which ſolemnity was hancelled with the Blood of many <hi>Jews,</hi> (though utterly againſt the Kings will) who preſſing into the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey to ſee His Coronation, were in a tumult furiouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was He Crowned, but (by the inſtigation of the Pope) He was engaged with <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France, Leopold</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> and many other Chriſtian Princes in the famous <hi>Croſiade</hi> for the winning of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at that time poſſeſſed by the <hi>Souldan Saladine;</hi> therefore for the raiſing of Money for this intended Pilgrimage, He rather choſe to furniſh Himſelf out of His own Eſtate, then to burthen His People; which He did by ſelling Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, Deameans, Immunities, and Cities; among which, He ſold <hi>Berwick</hi> Caſtle and <hi>Roxborrow,</hi> to the King of <hi>Scots</hi> for Ten thouſand Pounds; and the Earldom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> to <hi>Hugh Pudſey</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> for much Money, (at whoſe Creation King <hi>Richard</hi> told the ſtanders by, <hi>That he was a good Craftſman, that had made a new Earl of an old Biſhop)</hi> and alſo did proteſt, <hi>That for the performing of ſo juſt and honorable a Service, He was not unwilling to ſell His City of</hi> London <hi>its ſelf</hi> (if any there were able to purchaſe it) <hi>rather then to be chargeable to others.</hi>

                  <p>As for Men and Soldiers, the Clergy that undertook the cauſe, had ſtirred up innumerable; but the onely main danger of the State, was His Brother <hi>John,</hi> whoſe aſpiring minde he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to moderate by making it appear, how much the bounty of a Brother did exceed the hardneſs of a Father; for he conferred on him the-Earldoms of <hi>Cornwal, Lancaſter,</hi> and <hi>Dorſet;</hi> and by the Marriage with <hi>Iſabell,</hi> one of the Daughters and Heirs of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Conſul of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> he had that Earldom alſo; many other peeces likewiſe he enjoyed, in all amounting to Four thouſand Marks yearly: But having made him thus powerful, <hi>Richard</hi> yet takes away that opportunity which might put him upon the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation

<p>Being King, <hi>Edward</hi> made uſe of 3 ſeveral Great Seals, upon the firſt of which (delineaed in the 123 <hi>Page</hi> of this 3d. <hi>Book.</hi>) He is figured on his Throne <hi>between</hi> 2 <hi>Collateral Flowers de Lize,</hi> to denote his deſcent from a Daughter of <hi>France.</hi> This Grant beares date at <hi>Roxborrow</hi> (in <hi>Scotland</hi>) the 16 day of <hi>January, An.</hi> 8 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and is in the Regiſtry of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Abbey</p>
                        <p>His Second Royal Seal affixed to a Deed dated at <hi>Windſor</hi> upon the 20th day of <hi>September</hi> in the 13 year of his Reign, <hi>An.</hi> 1339. differs materially from the former only in this particular, That the King on his Throne is ſeated betwixt 6 <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons paſſant guardant, on each ſide</hi> 3, all reſpecting His Royal Seat.

King of <hi>France</hi> changed the <hi>Semee Flowers de Lize, into Three,</hi> our King <hi>Henry</hi> V. did the like, and ſo hath it continued ever ſince.</p>
                        <p>As <hi>Edward</hi> III. was the firſt of our Kings, who Quartered Armes in His Seal, ſo was He the firſt King that on His Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeal repreſents you with a <hi>Creſt,</hi> being <hi>a Lyon paſſant guardant crowned upon a Chapeau,</hi> with which His Figure on Horſeback is adorned, and which our ſucceeding Monarchs down to <hi>Edward</hi> VI. incluſive, have continued in their Royal Seals. And furthermore we muſt obſerve, that in the Margin of this Counterſeal, near to the point of the Kings Sword, is repreſented the <hi>Hand of Juſtice,</hi> being an Enſign of Royalty peculiar only to the Kings of <hi>France;</hi> for although the Monarchs of the <hi>Lillies</hi> carry in their Right Hands <hi>a Scepter of Gold</hi> (which is common to other Princes) yet in the other they bear <hi>The Hand of Juſtice, being a Rod of a Cubit in height, having on the top thereof a Left Hand wide open, of Ivory, pure white, framed out of the Tooth of the Elephant, which among all four-footed Beaſts is obſervable for his Devotion and Piety, love to his Governors, and alſo for his Equity:</hi> The reaſon why the Left Hand is here preferred before the Right, is ſaid to be becauſe that the Left Hand not being employed to the working of many diſhoneſt actions, or violent, without art, deceipt, or induſtry, is much more proper to repreſent and ſignifie the Rudder or Sterne of Juſtice, than the Right Hand: Moſt aptly therefore was this Hand of Juſtice placed at the point of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Sword (in His Counterſeal,) ſeeming to intend, that as the Sword of Force in the Right Hand of Power, was to be uſed in obtaining that Kingdom; yet that Sword only pointed out to the hand of Juſtice, for the Rule and Government thereof. You may find this hand ſo placed in the Counterſeals of His Succeſſors <hi>Richard</hi> II. and <hi>Henry</hi> IV: <hi>Henry</hi> V. omitted it in His Seal, and Conquering <hi>France,</hi> both placed that Crown on the Head; and the French Scepter, and this Rod of Juſtice in the Hands of his Son and Succeſſor King <hi>Henry</hi> VI.</p>

Not willing patiently to expect (with <hi>Edmond</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> his Brother, the freeing of his <hi>Falcon</hi> from the <hi>Fetterlock</hi> of ſervitude, till King <hi>Edward</hi> IV, his Great Grandſon opened it with the right Key.)

                  <p>In the Effigies of the Ducheſs <hi>Eleanor,</hi> it's obſervable, that the Arms of <hi>Edmond</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> her Husband, are embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon here <hi>Mantle</hi> or upper Garment, and there placed, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that the Husband as a Cloak or Mantle, is to ſhroud the Wife from all thoſe violent ſtorms againſt which her tender Sex is not capable of making a defence. The <hi>Arms</hi> of her Houſe are depicted upon her <hi>Kirtle,</hi> which (being under covert of the Husband or upper Garment) are to denote the Family of which ſhe is deſcended.

                     <note place="margin">Two ſeveral Seals of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. have come to my hands, the firſt differing from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in theſe two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <hi>viz.</hi> the form of the Throne, and the Titles in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; for the Fabrick of the Kings Throne in the firſt Seal is <hi>Gothick</hi> work, and that in the other <hi>Roman.</hi> The Stile in the circumference of the firſt Seal, was made uſe of when he had the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> conferred on him by Pope <hi>Leo X. An.</hi> 1521. <hi>viz.</hi> HENRICUS VIII. ANGLIE ET FRANCIE REX FIDEI DEFENSOR ET DOMINUS HIBERNIE. But being in the year 1534. declared in Parliament, <hi>Head of the Church of England,</hi> and afterwards, <hi>An.</hi> 1541. proclaimed King of <hi>Ireland;</hi> he cauſed this ſecond great Seal to be made (delineated in the 427 page of this ſixth Book) the Circle whereof is charged with theſe words, HENRICUS OCTAVUS, DEI GRATIA, ANGLIE FRANCIE ET HIBERNIE REX, FIDEI DEFENSOR, ET IN TERRA, ECCLESIE ANGLICANE ET HIBERNICE, SUPREMUM CAPUT, by which it appeareth, that this King cauſed his Seals to be circumſcribed with <hi>Roman</hi> Capitals, whereas all the Inſcriptions of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> his predeceſſors, from <hi>Richard</hi> II. incluſive (as you may obſerve in the circle of their Seals) were in old Engliſh Letters.
<p>The Kings Arms, <hi>(being France and England quarterly)</hi> on each ſide his Throne, upon both Seals, are placed within the Garter, and Enſigned with arched Crowns: He being the firſt King of <hi>England</hi> that in his Seal added to his Shield, the Garter and <hi>the Crown.</hi> In imitation of which Royal Example, the Knights of the Order, in the latter end of his Reign, cauſed their Eſcocheons on their Stalls at <hi>Windſor,</hi> to be encompaſſed with the Garter; and thoſe that were Dukes, Marquiſſes, or Earls, had their Coronets placed upon their Shields, which hath been ſo practiſed ever ſince, And whereas all the precedent Kings of <hi>England,</hi> from King <hi>Edward</hi> I. had the Enſigns of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms repreſented on the Capariſons of their Horſes in their counter-Seals: this King diſcontinued the ſame, and in place thereof, cauſed his Capariſons to be embroidered, on the upper part, with ſmall Flowers de Lize placed in Net-Work; and on the nether part, with large Roſes and Branches emboſſed, the edge thereof being garniſhed with a deep Fringe. Both before and behind the Kings Horſe, within the Circle, are placed ſeveral Ovals, alternately charged with Roſes and Flowers de Lize: and underneath the Horſe is a Greyhound <hi>current,</hi> with a Collar about his Neck; which this King did uſe, to ſhew his deſcent, by his Mother Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from the Royal Houſe of <hi>York</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The like Greyhounds are thus placed in the Seals of our ſucceeding Monarchs, <hi>Edward</hi> VI. King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and his preſent Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in the beginning of his Reign, bare his Arms ſupported with <hi>a Dragon,</hi> on the right ſide, and <hi>a Greyhound</hi> on the left (as did his Father King <hi>Henry</hi> VII.) which Achievement is ſo painted over his Picture in the Privy Gallary at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and alſo carved in Stone over the great Gate-Houſe of that Palace in the paſſage to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſubſcribed, DIEV ET MON DROIT: But afterwards he diſcontinued the <hi>Greyhound,</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his Shield on the right ſide with one of the <hi>Lyons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>a Lyon guardant Or,</hi> and tranſpoſed the <hi>Red Dragon</hi> to the left ſide of his Eſcocheon Royal, as appeareth on the Sterns of ſeveral of this Kings Ships, in that famous Picture in the ſaid Gallary at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> expreſſing his moſt glorious Naval Expedition into <hi>France,</hi> all the Sails of the Admiral being Cloth of Gold. The ſaid Supporters of the <hi>Lyon</hi> (Crowned) and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> are ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his Gold Coyn, which were continued by his three Children, King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (until her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage) and Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe Supporters, and others of his Predeceſſors, the King adorned his Pavilions and Tents; for in <hi>Edward Halle fol.</hi> 28. we read (at the Siege of <hi>Terwin</hi>) that at the top of the Pavilions ſtood the Kings Beaſts, holding Fanes, as <hi>the Lyon, the Dragon, the Greyhound, the Antelope, the Dun Cow,</hi> &amp;c. I needed not have paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea for an example of this kind, for the Fanes on the Kings Palaces of <hi>Hampton-court</hi> and <hi>Whitehall,</hi> are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Beaſts beforenamed.</p>
                        <p>This Kings Hereditary Deviſes or Badges; were <hi>a Red Roſe, a Flower de Lize, Or,</hi> and <hi>a Golden Portcullis.</hi> But in his time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wits beginning to imitate the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> in theſe Devices, by adding the <hi>Mots;</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf at the Interview between him and King <hi>Francis</hi> I. whereat alſo <hi>Charles</hi> V. was preſent; uſed for his Impreſs, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Archer in a green Coat, drawing his Arrow to the head, with this Inſcription, CUI ADHAEREO, PRAEEST: whereas at that time thoſe two mighty Princes banding one againſt the other, wrought him for their own particular. <hi>Camdens Remains</hi> p: 216.217.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Images were prepared, and part of this glorious Pile erected, when the reformation of Religion, by this Kings Son <hi>Edward</hi> VI. would not admit of the finiſhing thereof; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Statues being preſerved in the ſaid Chappel till the year 1642, were, ſince, by the prevailing party of the late Long Parliament, and their Sword Alchimie, turned into Silver, towards

                  </p>
                  <p>It was now the fifth year of her Reign, when the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> under the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> having raiſed a Rebellion in that Kingdom, were aſſiſted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with an Army of 6000 men commanded by <hi>Ambroſe Dudley</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> unto whom the Town of <hi>Newhaven</hi> was delivered, towards which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> marching, was intercepted by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and taken Priſoner; whereupon a Peace was concluded between them, and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> required by the <hi>French</hi> (nay even by the Rebels themſelves) to redeliver the place, which at length he did by the Queens Order.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſending into <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Calais</hi> might be ſurrendred unto her according to the former Treaty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this anſwer, <hi>That her Intereſt therein was forfeited by her

                  <p>The Queen having created <hi>Robert Dudley</hi> (Maſter of the Horſe) firſt, Baron of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and then Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> propoſes him in Marriage to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> promiſing upon her acceptance of him, ſhe ſhould be declared her Succeſſor to the Crown; but ſhe having refuſed ſeveral great Matches, by reaſon of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> diſapprobation, rejected this for the meaneſs of his Quality, fancying rather the young Lord <hi>Darnley,</hi> eldeſt Son to the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> (at that time a long Exile with his Father in <hi>England</hi>) as being of <hi>Engliſh</hi> birth, and reputed, next her, Heir to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> Them Queen <hi>Mary</hi> recalls into <hi>Scotland;</hi> to which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> after two years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, they arrive at <hi>Edenborough</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> and five months after (contrary to the inclination of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who to prevent it, had a little before remanded both the Father and Son into <hi>England</hi> upon their Allegeance) this Princely Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, then about 19 years of age was married to that Queen.</p>
                  <p>In the interim, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> requeſt her Majeſty to think of Marriage, accuſing her indifferency for preſervation of Poſterity, and declaiming againſt her Councellor <hi>Cecil,</hi> and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian Dr. <hi>Huit,</hi> as ſuſpected to adviſe her to the contrary; when the Queen ordering 30 of both Houſes to come before her, gave them ſo great ſatisfaction in that particular, as never after to trouble her therewith.</p>

But ſo potent were her Adverſaries in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they wanted not opportunities to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it, by ſuggeſting to the Queen the dangerous conſequences thereof, which was ſeconded with ſuch ſcandalous and contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious bellowings, from the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Pulpits againſt her, and other ſtratagems and devices, as might if poſſible drive her to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate attempt; but failing, Aſſaſſinates were by <hi>Leiceſter</hi> ſent to make her away; which they had certainly done, if Sir <hi>Drue Drury,</hi> and Sir <hi>Amias Paulet,</hi> to whom ſhe was now committed, had not deteſted ſo horrid a Villany.</p>
                  <p>In this Seſſion of Parliament,<note place="margin">Anno 1584.</note> the aforeſaid Aſſociation was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally approved of; and 'twas Enacted, that twenty four of the Queens Councel and Peers of the Realm ſhould be elected and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to enquire of all ſuch perſons as ſhould attempt any evil againſt the Queen, lay claim to the Crown, attempt, or invade the Kingdom; and that perſon, by, or for whom the ſame ſhall either be attempted or invaded, to be made incapable of the Crown, and liable to the Law.</p>
                  <p>The poor diſtreſſed States of the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> being now again drawn into a ſad ſtraight, and neglected by the <hi>French,</hi> more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly than ever ſollicite Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> aſſiſtance, who conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the growing potency of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the lamentable condition of thoſe afflicted people, reſolved actually to take them into her Protection, and to ſupply them with a 1000 Horſe, and 5000 Foot, with Pay during the War, on condition that the Forts of <hi>Fluſhing, Ramekin,</hi> and the <hi>Brill,</hi> ſhould be delivered up to her uſe; which being agreed to, the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> as General, with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Lords <hi>Audley,</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> &amp;c, with a great number of Volunteers, beſides the before promiſed Forces, landed at <hi>Fluſhing</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> 1584. where they were honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> Governor of that place; whence being with great magnificence conducted to the <hi>Hague</hi> by the States of <hi>Holland, Leiceſter</hi> is inveſted with the Titles of abſolute Governor, and General of all the United Provinces; whereat Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſeemed ſomewhat diſpleaſed, as being too great a preſumption in them to beſtow, and in him to accept them, without the Queens knowledge and conſent.</p>
                  <p>The Peace thus broken with <hi>Spain,</hi> the Queen, to divert that Kings anger further from home, immediately fits our a Navy of twenty one ſhips, for the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> where they ſurprized many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Towns, when a Calenture ſeizing on their Men, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a very great Booty homewards by <hi>Virginia,</hi> where Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> had planted a Colony, from whence they now firſt brought Tabaco into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> having remained near a year in the Tower,<note place="margin">Anno 1585.</note> was ſummoned into the Star-Chamber, where he is charged with
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:50646:266"/>the Foſtering of Prieſts, having Correſpondence with <hi>Allen,</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> the Jeſuite, and his endeavouring to depart the Kingdom; for which being convicted, he was Fined 10000 <abbr>

                     </abbr> and committed again to the Tower during the Queens pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>About which time another Conſpiracy was diſcovered againſt the Queen, for which one <hi>Ballard</hi> a Prieſt,<note place="margin">Anno 1586.</note> and thirteen more were hanged, drawn, and quartered in <hi>St Giles</hi>'s Fields. Whereupon the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> being ſuppoſed conſcious of the Treaſon, it was conſulted what ſhould be done with her, when concluding to put in execution, the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> made about a year ſince, by the procurement of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and his Aſſociation, for that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Commiſſioners are appointed to proceed againſt her; who after many meetings at <hi>Fotheringhay</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> in order to her Tryal, finding her to inſiſt on her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and exemption as a Sovereign Princeſs, threatned her at laſt into a compliance; whereupon the Court being ſate in her preſence Chamber, and the charge read, ſhe replyed, That the Letters produced might be Counterfeits, the Treaſons confeſſed might be extorted for fear of death, motions for the Queens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhe was never privy to; but for practiſing her own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, as a thing juſtifiable in her, ſhe denied not, deſiring to be heard in Parliament before the Queen herſelf; which not being granted, the Commiſſioners proceed to Sentence, which in the end was performed, 1 <hi>Aug.</hi> 1586. when, upon a Scaffold, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely erected in the great Hall of the Caſtle of <hi>Foderinghay,</hi> ſhe was after nineteen years impriſonment, unhappily beheaded.</p>
                  <p>To excuſe which, Sir <hi>Robert Cary,</hi> ſon to the Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> is ſent to King <hi>James,</hi> charging <hi>Davyſon</hi> the Queens Secretary, and her too credulous Councel with the Fault, proteſting the Queens intention otherwiſe. But the King denied him acceſs at the firſt till means were found to perſuade him to continue Amity with <hi>England.</hi> However a War from <hi>Spain</hi> muſt certainly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and therefore it is reſolved to attack them firſt; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> with others, are ordered to Sea, who ſunk, took, and fired in the Harbor of <hi>Cales</hi> 100 ſhips, took 4 Forts at <hi>Cape St Vincent,</hi> and performing other eminent Exploits about the Weſtern Iſles, returned with great ſpoil.

                  <p>At this time a Treaty was held between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Ostend,</hi> but nothing concluded, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Delegates diſmiſt,<note place="margin">Anno 1588.</note> a great Navy immediately appeared before the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> conſiſting in about 130 ſhips, aboard which 19290 Soldiers,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion.</note> 8350 Mariners, 2080 Gally ſlaves, and 2630 great Ordnance; to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe which, the Queen provides and ſets forth her Navy, under the command of the Lord <hi>Charles Howard</hi> Admiral, Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> Vice-Admiral, <hi>Hawkins, Forbiſher,</hi> and others; who ſetting ſail from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> the 21 of <hi>July</hi> bore up to them, and after the

                  <p>The next year after,<note place="margin">Anno 1589.</note> to revenge this Invaſion, the Queen gave leave to Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> and others, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a Voyage into <hi>Spain,</hi> to endeavor the eſtabliſhment of <hi>Don Antonio</hi> into the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who ſetting forth from <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> the 5th of <hi>April,</hi> landed at <hi>Groyne</hi> in <hi>Galitia,</hi> which they took, and ſailing thence into <hi>Portugal</hi> were met by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who joining them, they proceeded to <hi>Penycha,</hi> which they alſo took, and thence to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where all expectations ſailing, they were repulſed;<note place="margin">Anno 1591.</note> yet ſeiſing on 60 Hulks in their retreat laden with Corn and Ammunition, they came and pillaged <hi>Virgo</hi> and the adjacent Countrey, and ſo returned into <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>This year the Queen ſent the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with 4000 men, to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Navarre, Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> a Proteſtant, in the gaining the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which was left him by the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> III. againſt the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> Head of the League, whoſe Declaration was for a Catholick King; who landing in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> directed his way to that King then at <hi>Noyon,</hi> where they concluded upon the beſieging of <hi>Roan,</hi> which was afterwards ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: about which time one <hi>Hacket</hi> pretending himſelf to be <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

The fruit of this marriage ſoon appeared in the Queens being with Child; but her love to King <hi>Henry</hi> was not ſo warm at firſt but it began now as much to cool, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had not heaped Honours on him ſo faſt before, but he is now as ſuddenly deveſted of them; for where before in all publick Acts, ſhe uſed to place her Husbands name firſt, now ſhe cauſed it to be placed after hers, and in the Coining of Mony, began to leave it quite out. This unkindneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, was chiefly fomented by one <hi>David Rizie</hi> an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> her Secretary for the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, by means whereof he had often times Conference with her, when the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might not be admitted; which indignity the King inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Of the foulneſs of which fact, when King <hi>Henry</hi> after a while grew ſenſible, he meant to be revenged on <hi>Murray,</hi> who had councelled him to it: which the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> underſtanding, prevented it, with cauſing the like to be done to him. For the Queen having been delivered of her Son (<hi>James</hi> VI. of the name, King of <hi>Scots,</hi> afterwards Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> &amp;c.) and the day of the Chriſtning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being requeſted to be Godmother, ſent thither the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> as her Deputy, and a Font of maſſie Gold for a Preſent, in value 1043 <abbr>

After whoſe deceaſe, <hi>Mary</hi> the Queen-Dowager (having no Iſſue by him) retired into <hi>Scotland;</hi> where ſhe afterwards took to her ſecond Husband her Couſin <hi>Henry Stewart</hi> Lord <hi>Darley</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi>

                  <p>Few years had Queen <hi>Mary</hi> enjoyed her ſecond Husband <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> when by the practiſes of the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> her baſe Brother (who had animated the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> to aſſaſſinate <hi>David Rizie</hi> her Secretary) he was moſt cruelly murthered; ſo that the Queen being thereby left alone, is councelled to marry with ſome perſon that might be able to aſſiſt her againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. The man pitched upon, is <hi>James Hepburn</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> being then great in her favor, and of ſingular eminency for his Valor. And though he were the perſon that had acted the Kings murther, yet is he, by <hi>Murray, Morton,</hi> and their Confederates, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the Queen; to which motion, as being deſtitute of Friends, and not knowing whom to truſt, ſhe at laſt conſents: But upon theſe Conditions, That above all things reſpect might be had to her young Son <hi>James,</hi> and that <hi>Bothwell</hi> might be legally quitted both from the Bond of his former Marriage, and alſo of the Kings murther. Hereupon a courſe is plotted, by which Earl <hi>Bothwell</hi> is called to the Bar, and (<hi>Morton</hi> being his Advocate) by the Sentence of the Judges, clearly acquitted.<note place="margin">Her third Marriage.</note> Upon this he is created Duke of <hi>Orkney,</hi> and many of the Nobility conſenting, married to Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> which bred a ſuſpicion in ſeveral, that the Queen was conſcious of the murther, the thing indeed that by the marriage they intended: which ſuſpicion once raiſed, they ſeek by all means to increaſe, thereby to have the better colour againſt her; and ſo the very ſame man who had abſolved <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and conſented to the marriage, now, with others, takes Arms againſt her, as a delinquent in both; force him to fly, and then ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queen, whom clad in very homely Garments, they thruſt into Priſon at <hi>Loch-Levyn</hi> under the cuſtody of <hi>Murray</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had been the Harlot of King <hi>James</hi> V. but boaſted herſelf to have been his Lawful Wife, and this Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> her Son, the King's lawfully begotten Son.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being informed of theſe proceedings againſt the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> ſends Sir <hi>Nicholas Throckmorton</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to expoſtulate with the Confederates, touching their cruel uſage of her, and to conſult by what means ſhe might be reſtored to her liberty. Being come into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he found the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in more inſolent terms than report had made them, being divided in opinion what to do with the Queen; ſome would have her baniſhed perpetually; others committed to Priſon, and her Son proclaimed King; others, more inhumane, were for having her to be deprived of Princely Authority, life and all; and this <hi>Knox</hi>
                     <pb n="504" facs="tcp:50646:274"/>and ſome other Miniſters thundred out of the Pulpits. <hi>Throck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton</hi> on the other ſide maintained that the Queen was ſubject to no Tribunal but that in Heaven, and that there was no Jurisdiction in <hi>Scotland</hi> which was not derived from her Authority, and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable at her pleaſure. To which they oppoſed the peculiar right of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that in extraordinary Caſes they were to proceed beſides order: taking up <hi>Buchannans</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: who in thoſe days by inſtigation of <hi>Murray,</hi> wrote that damned Dialogue, <hi>De jure Regni apud Scotos.</hi> After all this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, what <hi>Throckmorton</hi> could get of them, was a Writing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Subſcription, in which they proteſted they had ſhut up the Queen only to keep her from <hi>Bothwell,</hi> whom ſhe loved ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately, that to enjoy him ſhe regarded not all their ruins; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to reſt ſatisfied with this anſwer, till ſuch time as all the Peers met together. The Queen was yet confined to a more cloſe impriſonment, and through fear of death, compelled unheard, to ſet her hand to three Inſtruments; The firſt whereof contained, the reſignation of her Kingdom to her young Son, at that time ſcarce thirteen months old; In the ſecond, ſhe conſtituted <hi>Murray</hi> Vice-Roy during the minority of her ſaid Son; And in the third, in caſe he refuſed the charge, the Governors nominated, were, <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Chaſtean-Herald, Giles Spike</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle, Mathew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> (the Queens Father-in-Law) <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Atholl, James</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton, Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Mar.</hi> And preſently ſhe ſignified to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by <hi>Throck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi> that ſhe had made theſe Grants by compulſion, through the counſel of <hi>Throckmorton,</hi> telling her, that a Grant extorted from one in Priſon (which is a juſt fear) is actually void and of none effect. Five days after this Reſignation, <hi>James</hi> VI. the Queens Son, was Anointed and Crowned King, <hi>James Knox</hi> Preaching at the ſame time; but Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had forbidden <hi>Throckmorton</hi> to be thereat, that ſhe might not ſeem by the preſence of her Embaſſador to approve their proceeding in the diſplacing of the Queen of <hi>Scots:</hi> Who ſome time after (having been a Priſoner eleven months) makes her eſcape from <hi>Loch-levyn</hi> to <hi>Hamilton</hi> Caſtle; where, upon the Teſtimonies of <hi>Robert Melvyn,</hi> and others, in a meeting of a great part of the Nobility, there was drawn a Sentence Declaratory, that the Grant extorred from the Queen in Priſon (which is <hi>Juſtus Metus</hi>) was actually void from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; upon which great multitudes flocked unto her; ſo as within a day or two, ſhe had gotten an Army of at leaſt 6000. But when they joined Battel with <hi>Murray,</hi> being but raw and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Soldiers, they were ſoon defeated; ſo that the Queen ſought to ſave herſelf by flight, journying in one day threeſcore Miles, and coming at night to the houſe of <hi>Maxwell</hi> Lord <hi>Heris.</hi> From thence ſhe ſent <hi>John Beton</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Ring, which ſhe had formerly received from her, as a Pledge of Mutual Amity; intimating, that ſhe would come into <hi>England,</hi> and implore her aid, if her Subjects offered to proſecute her any
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:50646:274"/>farther. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> returned anſwer, that ſhe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from her, in abundant manner, all loving and friendly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. But before the Meſſenger was returned, ſhe, contrary to the advice of her Friends, entred into a ſmall Bark, and with the Lords <hi>Heris,</hi> and <hi>Fleming,</hi> and a few others, landed at <hi>Wickington</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> near the mouth of the River <hi>Derwent.</hi>

                     <hi>February</hi> the 6th, a Parliament was called, whereof Sir <hi>Henry Finch</hi> was Speaker, in which, after Thanks rendred His Majeſty for his Gratious Anſwer to their Petition concerning Religion, their next Debate fell upon the Grievances of the Kingdom by Evil Councellors, and clipping of the Kings Wings as to his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Purſe and publick Grants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the principal String on which they harped, was Religion, keeping thereon a kind of a conſtant Committee, whereof one <hi>John Pym</hi> a turbulant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was Chairman; ſo that the Kings Ears were never free from their noiſe, daily fomented by two turbulent Members of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>Clement Cook</hi> and one <hi>Turner</hi> a Phiſitian, till at laſt the King was conſtrained to ſend them word by Sir <hi>Richard Weſton,</hi> that it was beſt for them to conſult of Matters of greateſt importance at preſent; and that they ſhould have time enough for other things afterwards.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Anno 1626.</note>Several thwarting accuſations at this time paſſed in Parliament between the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters acted in the late Kings time, wherein they recriminate upon each other. In fine, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſuſtains the laſh of all their contumely, which though to every Article he gave as good ſatisfaction as in reaſon could be expected, yet their rage ceaſed not to prefer new matters of old Concernments againſt him, which though true (as he urged) ought not then to have been remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, ſince in Parliament, <hi>An.</hi> 21. of King <hi>James,</hi> he had been acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beſides his preſent Majeſties General Pardon at his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſufficient to free him, as it did all others, from the like Imputation.

                  <p>After this an Information was at the Council Table preferred againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> by Sir <hi>John Lambe,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp,</hi> as favouring the Puritans, ſpeaking dangerous words in their behalf againſt the King, and oppoſing the Loan which now the King was about taking up in order to a War with <hi>France:</hi> For which the Biſhop, with ſome others of the ſame Faction, were impriſoned: Doctor <hi>Lamb</hi> is murdered in the Streets of <hi>London</hi> by the Rabble, for which the City is fined 6000 <abbr>l.</abbr> Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Epedition to Iſle of <hi>Rhe.</hi>

                  <p>The Parliament at this time growing ſtubborn againſt the King,<note place="margin">Anno 1628.</note> would needs by a Vote take off the Subſidies granted him of Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and Poundage, whereupon His Majeſty ſending Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi> Uſher of the Black Rod to diſſolve them, they denie it, till the King with his Penſioners and Guard preparing to come himſelf, they quitted the Houſe; and thus ended that Parliament. For now, what with the continual clamour of the Commonalty againſt the Introduction of Popery (as they called it) and their perpetual grumblings againſt Taxes, the Puritanical Faction grow ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and bold, that Libels are daily caſt about the Streets againſt the King and Clergy, eſpecially Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and others of the Kings moſt faithfull Councellors, which though by all the gratious

                  <p>It was now the 6th year of the Kings Reign,<note place="margin">Anno 1630.</note> when on the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> the Queen was happily delivered of her eldeſt Son (our preſent Soveraign Lord King <hi>Charles</hi>) whoſe Nativity was uſhered in with a Star ſeen at noon-day.

                     <note place="margin">Anno 1632.</note> which for ſeveral years continued; and another more horrid had taken root in <hi>Scotland.</hi> That, by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Recuſants, upon pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining their Ancient Freedom from their long continued ſlavery; and this, upon the contrary account, for fear of Popery: But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the humble intreaty of the <hi>Scots,</hi> the King in the ninth year of his Reign over <hi>England, An.</hi> 1633. takes his Journy thither,<note place="margin">Anno 1633.</note> and is ſolemnly Crowned at <hi>Edenborough</hi> the 18th of <hi>June,</hi> where he called a Parliament, in which he confirmed many old Statutes, but not without the oppoſition of the diſcontented Reformers (as they called themſelves) as ſuppoſing the ſame to have been done in favor of Epiſcopacy.

                  <p>The good effects of the laſt Expedition cauſed the King to ſet out another Fleet under command of the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>

                  <p>The King,<note place="margin">Anno 1640.</note> upon his return, the 13th of <hi>April,</hi> called another Parliament, who firſt require of the King to be ſatisfied in three Points, <hi>viz.</hi> Property of the Subject; Security of Religion; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Parliament. But whil'ſt they conſidered which was beſt firſt to be treated of, comes in that Firebrand Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> and falſly told them, that the King demanded twelve Subſidies: whereat they fell into ſuch a heat againſt his Majeſty, that they reſolve to Vote againſt the War with <hi>Scotland;</hi> upon which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter twenty two days Seſſion, by advice of his Counſel, he diſſolved them.</p>
                  <p>This done, the Convocation now ſitting, framed a Proteſtation for the ſettlement of the Church, wherein the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> Dr. <hi>William Laud</hi> ſhewed himſelf very zealous againſt the Puritans: Hereupon a Paper was poſted on the old Exchange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the Apprentices to Rifle his Houſe at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> which, on Monday the 12th of <hi>May,</hi> at night, they attempted, but were repulſed, many taken and impriſoned, which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by their Companions forcibly reſcued; for which one of the Ringleaders was taken and hanged.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> ſtill continuing their inſolence, the King was once more obliged to march with an Army againſt them towards <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> where, at <hi>Newburne</hi> near <hi>Newcaſtle, Leſley,</hi> with his Forces, meets part of the Kings Army commanded by the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> upon the 28th of <hi>August,</hi> at the River <hi>Tyne;</hi> and after a hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, the <hi>Scots</hi> gain their paſſage, and put thoſe Forces to flight. His Majeſty hereupon retires to <hi>York,</hi> is there contented to Treat with them, receiving their Petition, which, in effect, contained, That a Parliament ſhould be forthwith called: The Reformed Religion in both Kingdoms confirmed: The Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> brought to the Bar. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in reſpect of a Parliament, was ſeconded by many factious Lords of <hi>England;</hi> So that upon condition the <hi>Scots</hi> would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:50646:294"/>the King at laſt was content to promiſe them a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis of <hi>Montroſs</hi> deteſting the perfidious proceedings of his Countrymen, though he had been a Covenanter, became now Loyal, as by certain Letters to His Majeſty appeared, which by the Treachery of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> were ſtolen out of the Kings Pocket, tranſcribed, and the Copies conveyed to the Covenanters, which rendred the Earl odious among them. However, through their daily importunities, the King, in purſuance of his promiſe, called a Parliament,<note place="margin">The Long Parliament <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. <hi>Anno</hi> 1640.</note> which began at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Tueſday the 3d of <hi>November.</hi> With which began all the Kings miſery (though with the former Parliaments he had trouble ſufficient) for the firſt thing they fell upon for the pleaſing of the people, was the reduction of Monopolies; receiving of Petitions from ſuch as for their turbulency had ſuffered in the Starchamber, Council Table, or High Commiſſion Court; and ſtriking at the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> againſt whom Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> is ſent to the Houſe of Lords, with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of High Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>And now came Alderman <hi>Pennington</hi> with ſeveral hundreds at his heels, bringing a Petition of the Citizens againſt Church Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; whereupon it was Voted that the Clergy in no Synod or Convocation have any power to make Canons, but the Parliament; That the preſent Canons of the Church were againſt the Laws; for which the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as one of the chief Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of them, muſt be accuſed, and likewiſe, with the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> committed to the Black Rod, againſt whom the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with full Mouthes, now exhibit their Charge,<note place="margin">Anno 1640.</note> fraught with nothing elſe but inverterate Malice and groundleſs Conjectures; and all for fear of Popery: The Parliament at this time taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to expoſtulate with the King concerning the Reprieve of one <hi>Goodman</hi> a Prieſt: as though it lay not in the Kings power, without them, to pardon any Malefactor whatſoever after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                  <p>After many horrid Clamours, the King on the 15th of <hi>February</hi> paſſes that fatal Bill for a Triennial Parliament; upon which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Tryal, who,<note place="margin">Anno 1641.</note> to every Article prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt him, gave ſufficient anſwer; yet, ſince by the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of all together, they found him guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the King unwillingly complyed with what he knew was but out of Malice contrived, and ſigned the Warrant for his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which to His Majeſties own death he repented) and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he is beheaded on <hi>Tower</hi> Hill on the 12th of <hi>May</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Hereupon the Parliament ſeem contented, and yield that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army ſhould be disbanded (having Voted 300000 <abbr>l.</abbr> towards ſupply of the loſſes and neceſſities of their dear Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi>) which, contrary to their former Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the late Treaty, they had kept above eight Months in <hi>England;</hi> and the King, the more to oblige them, makes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he ſtays about four Months; during
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:50646:295"/>which time the Rebellion before ſpoken of in <hi>Ireland,</hi> breaks forth into action: the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> had like to have been ſeized the 23d of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. but the ſame night the deſign was diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Owen O Conally;</hi> whereupon the Lords <hi>Mac-Guire</hi> and <hi>Mac-Mahon,</hi> with divers others, are ſeized on; yet in all other parts of that Kingdom, the Plot ſucceeds, many places being ſurprized.

The War conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues long, many Places and Towns are taken on both ſides, and many bloody Cruelties committed.</p>
                  <p>The King returns from <hi>Scotland,</hi> cauſe Proclamation to be made for obedience to the Laws concerning Religion againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation either of Rights or Ceremonies, ſommoning both Houſes to appear before him, whereat they (diſguſted) frame a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, wherein all the misfortunes that had happened ſince the beginning of the Kings Reign, are remembred, and laid to the charge of the Biſhops and Papiſts; whereupon a tumultuous Rabble of <hi>London</hi> Apprentices and others in Arms, came before <hi>Whitehall,</hi> crying, <hi>Down with the Biſhops and the Whore of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> which by the Kings Servants out of <hi>Scotland</hi> Yard, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, but by the Commons Houſe gratified with a Vote (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all former Laws and firſt inſtitution of Parliaments) to aboliſh the Biſhops wholly from being Members or having any Votes in the Parliament Houſe: Whereupon twelve of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt the proceedings of the Commons, abſent themſelves, being all of them not long after charged with Treaſon, ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower, and two to the Black Rod.</p>
                  <p>The remaining Juncto (for a Parliament it cannot hereafter be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called) Petitioned the King for a Guard to be commanded by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> when His Majeſty had more need of one for himſelf: who ſending to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the rudeneſs of their Apprentices, he received no other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction than another Petition from them much to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the laſt from the Parliament; which the King denying, is informed that all the late Tumults were chiefly countenanced by five Members of the Commons Houſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pim,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> Mr. <hi>Strode,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamden,</hi> with whom the <hi>Scots</hi> had held Correſpondence in all their late diſturbances.

                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> too adventurous, was mortally wounded; and by reaſon of the abſence of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the Kings main Body was aſſaulted with great fury, and his Standard loſt (Sir <hi>Edmond Varney</hi> the Standard Bearer being killed) which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards retaken by Sir <hi>John Smith,</hi> Knighted therefore.

                  <p>At this the Parliament became ſo grievouſly diſturbed, that now either the powfull Preachings of their Miniſtry muſt help them, or never, to fit up an Army for <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> in miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtreſs, which was ſpeedily muſtered upon <hi>Hounſlow Heath,</hi> out of the inexhauſtible Treaſury of Rebellion, for the relief of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> now beſieged by the King; which upon the 5th of <hi>September</hi> they effected, His Majeſty upon their advance remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving towards <hi>London;</hi> which had He done before this laſt Army was raiſed, would in all likeliood have put an end to the War.</p>

<pb n="556" facs="tcp:50646:300"/>into the greater part of the Army, and carried on their Deſigns with more vigour and reſolution than the other.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty was by the <hi>Scots</hi> brought to <hi>Newcastle</hi> (fearing that <hi>Fairfax</hi> might have forced him out of their hands) from whence He ſent to the Sedentaries for a Treaty,<note place="margin">Anno 1646. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 20.</note> and they to Him return ſixteen Propoſitions without ever a word of Reaſon, which were therefore denied by the King, who deſired perſonally to Treat with them at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Scots</hi> having plainly told His Majeſty, <hi>That if He loſt</hi> England <hi>in not complying with the Parliament, as to the ſettlement of their Covenant, He ſhould not Reign in</hi> Scotland: They for 200000 <abbr>l.</abbr> in Money de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Him up to their diſpoſal; who preſently Vote him to be brought to <hi>Holmby</hi> Houſe, ordering <hi>Marſhal</hi> and <hi>Caryl</hi> two Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters for His Chaplains; which He abhorring, deſired two of His own, but was denied.</p>

                  <p>To their denial of Juſtice they added ſo many contumelies, indignities, and affronts, as would have tempted Him to deſpair, had not His Faith been as ſtrong as his Reaſon, and the greatneſs of his Mind more invincible than that of his Power.

                  <p>His Body was laid in a Coffin covered with black Velvet, and from thence carried to His Houſe at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where it was put in a Coffin of Lead, there to be ſeen by the People: On Wedneſday the 7th of <hi>February</hi> His Corps was delivered to two of His Servants, to be buried at <hi>Windſor,</hi> whither the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Hertford,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> together with Doctor <hi>Juxon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and divers others repaired.
